// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.


import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

import 'package:demo/main.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('App starts and navigates correctly (smoke test)', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    // Choose true or false based on what initial state you want to test.
    // For a general smoke test, testing)); // FIX: Changed null to false

    // The original test was for a counter app. Your app is different.
    // You'll need to update these expectations to match your actual app's UI.
    // For example, if isLoggedIn: false, you might expect to find text related to the login screen.

    // Example: If the login screen has a "Login" button:
    expect(find.text('Login'), findsOneWidget);

    // If you were testing the home screen (isLoggedIn: true), you might expect a specific element:
    // await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp(isLoggedIn: true));
    // expect(find.text("Today's Profit"), findsOneWidget); // Example from home_screen.dart

    // Note: The original test's "expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);"
    // and "expect(find.text('1'), findsNothing);" are from a default counter app template.
    // You should replace these with assertions relevant to your Kisan Krushi app's UI.
