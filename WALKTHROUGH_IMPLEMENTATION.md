# Walkthrough Screen Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive walkthrough screen has been implemented for the Kisan Krushi agricultural management app. The walkthrough appears only for non-logged-in users who haven't seen it before.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Animated Walkthrough Screen (`lib/Screens/walkthrough_screen.dart`)
- **3-page walkthrough** with smooth page transitions
- **Rich animations** including:
  - Rotating logo animation
  - Typewriter text effect
  - Fade and slide transitions
  - Scale and rotation animations for icons
- **Project-specific content** highlighting:
  - Stock Management
  - Sales Tracking
  - Profit Analysis
  - Customer Ledger
  - Google Drive Integration
  - Security features

### 2. Smart Navigation Logic
- Shows walkthrough only for **first-time users**
- Automatically skips walkthrough for **returning users**
- **Preference management** using GetStorage
- Smooth navigation to login screen after completion

### 3. User Experience Features
- **Skip button** to bypass walkthrough
- **Page indicators** showing progress
- **Previous/Next navigation**
- **Responsive design** with proper spacing
- **Agricultural theme** with green color scheme

## File Structure

```
lib/
├── Screens/
│   └── walkthrough_screen.dart      # Main walkthrough implementation
├── util/
│   └── preference_manager.dart      # Handles walkthrough seen status
├── routes/
│   ├── routes.dart                  # Added walkthrough route
│   └── app_page_routes.dart         # Route configuration
└── main.dart                        # Updated initial route logic
```

## How It Works

### Initial Route Logic
```dart
initialRoute: isLoggedIn 
    ? Routes.home 
    : (hasSeenWalkthrough ? Routes.login : Routes.walkthrough)
```

### Flow
1. **First-time user**: `Walkthrough → Login → Home`
2. **Returning user**: `Login → Home`
3. **Logged-in user**: `Home`

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. First Time User Experience
```bash
flutter run
```
- Should show walkthrough screen
- Navigate through 3 pages
- Complete or skip to login

### 2. Returning User Experience
```bash
# After completing walkthrough once, restart app
flutter run
```
- Should skip walkthrough and go directly to login

### 3. Reset Walkthrough (for testing)
Add this temporary code to test multiple times:
```dart
// In main.dart, before runApp():
await PreferenceManager.resetWalkthroughSeen(); // For testing only
```

## Walkthrough Content

### Page 1: Welcome & Features
- Animated app logo
- "Welcome to Kisan Krushi" with typewriter effect
- Core features: Stock Management, Sales Tracking, Profit Analysis

### Page 2: Analytics & Reporting
- Animated trending chart icon
- Customer Ledger, Profit Reports, Stock Reports
- Business insights and analytics focus

### Page 3: Cloud Storage & Security
- Rotating cloud sync icon
- Google Authentication
- Automatic Data Backup
- Real-time Synchronization

## Assets
- Uses existing `assets/applogo.png`
- Added `assets/walkthrough/` directory for future walkthrough-specific images
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` to include walkthrough assets

## Dependencies Used
- `get`: For navigation and state management
- `get_storage`: For storing walkthrough preference
- `flutter/material.dart`: For UI components and animations

## Customization Options

### Colors
```dart
backgroundColor: const Color(0xFF1B5E20), // Dark green theme
```

### Animation Durations
```dart
_animationController = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 1500), // Adjustable
  vsync: this,
);
```

### Page Count
```dart
final int _totalPages = 3; // Can be increased
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Add more walkthrough images
2. Include video demonstrations
3. Add interactive elements
4. Localization support
5. A/B testing for different walkthrough flows

## Troubleshooting

### Walkthrough Not Showing
- Check if `PreferenceManager.hasSeenWalkthrough()` returns `false`
- Verify user is not logged in
- Reset preferences for testing

### Navigation Issues
- Ensure all routes are properly defined in `app_page_routes.dart`
- Check import statements in route files

### Animation Performance
- Test on actual devices for smooth animations
- Adjust animation durations if needed on slower devices
