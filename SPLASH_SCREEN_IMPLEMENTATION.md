# Splash Screen Implementation

## Overview
An attractive animated splash screen has been successfully implemented for the Kisan Krushi Flutter app. The splash screen handles user authentication checking and automatic navigation to the appropriate screen.

## Features

### üé® Attractive Animations
- **Logo Animation**: Fade-in, scale, and slide effects with elastic bounce
- **Background Gradient**: Smooth green gradient transition matching the agricultural theme
- **Rotation Effect**: Subtle logo rotation for visual appeal
- **Loading Indicator**: Animated circular progress indicator
- **Text Effects**: Fade-in text with shadows and letter spacing

### üîê Authentication Logic
- Automatically checks if user is logged in using `GoogleSignInController`
- Waits for authentication initialization to complete
- Navigates to **Home Screen** if user is authenticated
- Navigates to **Login Screen** if user is not authenticated
- Handles errors gracefully by defaulting to login screen

### ‚ö° Performance
- Optimized animation controllers with proper disposal
- Timeout handling for authentication checks
- Non-blocking initialization
- Smooth transitions between screens

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`lib/Screens/splash_screen.dart`** - New splash screen widget
2. **`lib/routes/routes.dart`** - Added splash route
3. **`lib/routes/app_page_routes.dart`** - Added splash screen to routes
4. **`lib/main.dart`** - Updated initial route to splash screen

### Animation Sequence

1. **Background Fade** (300ms): Green gradient fades in
2. **Logo Animations** (1500ms): Logo slides up, fades in, and scales
3. **Rotation Effect** (2000ms): Subtle rotation animation
4. **Authentication Check** (2500ms): Checks login status
5. **Navigation** (3000ms): Redirects to appropriate screen

### Dependencies Used
- `flutter/material.dart` - Core Flutter widgets
- `get/get.dart` - State management and navigation
- Existing `GoogleSignInController` - Authentication logic

## Usage

The splash screen is now the initial route of the app. When users launch the app:

1. They see the animated splash screen with the app logo
2. The app checks their authentication status in the background
3. After animations complete, users are automatically directed to:
   - **Home Screen** if logged in
   - **Login Screen** if not logged in

## Customization

### Colors
The splash screen uses a green gradient theme suitable for agricultural apps:
- Primary: `#4CAF50`
- Secondary: `#2E7D32` 
- Accent: `#1B5E20`

### Timing
Animation timings can be adjusted in the `_startAnimationSequence()` method:
- Background fade: 300ms
- Logo animations: 1500ms
- Rotation: 2000ms
- Total splash duration: ~3.5 seconds

### Assets
Uses the existing `assets/applogo.png` for the logo display.

## Testing

To test the splash screen:

1. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
2. Launch the app with `flutter run`
3. The splash screen should appear first with animations
4. After completion, navigation should work based on authentication status

## Notes

- All animation controllers are properly disposed to prevent memory leaks
- Error handling ensures the app never gets stuck on the splash screen
- The implementation is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- Uses existing authentication infrastructure without modifications
